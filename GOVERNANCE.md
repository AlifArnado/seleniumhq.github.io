# Governance

The Selenium Project wants as much as possible to operate using procedures that
are fair, open, inviting, and ultimately good for the community. For that reason,
we find it valuable to codify some of the ways that the Project goes about its
day-to-day business. We want to make sure that no matter who you are, you have
the opportunity to contribute to Selenium. We want to make sure that no
corporation can exert undue influence on the community or hold the Project
hostage. And likewise, we want to make sure that corporations which benefit
from Selenium are also incentivized to give back. This document describes how
various types of contributors work within the Selenium project.
